This repository contains functional code for R and JAGS/BUGS which may be used to model the relationship between temperature 
and the rate of die-off of pathogenic bacteria. The repository is currently split into separate branches for the R code, which is 
devoted to data generation and processing, as well as initial parameter estimation, and JAGS/BUGS code, which seeks to provide a 
Bayesian framework for robust parameter estimation based on data from numerous studies.
